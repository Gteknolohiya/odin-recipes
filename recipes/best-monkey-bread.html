    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Monkey bread is a delicious and indulgent pull-apart bread made with layers of soft, sweet dough and gooey caramel sauce. To make the best monkey bread, start by mixing together the dough and dividing it into small balls, coating them in a mixture of butter and brown sugar, and layering them in a bundt pan. Cover the pan with foil and let the dough rise until doubled in size, then bake until golden brown and drizzle with a mixture of melted butter and brown sugar before serving.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup raisins (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9- or 10-inch tube or Bundt® pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix white sugar and cinnamon in a plastic bag. Cut biscuits into quarters. Shake 6 to 8 biscuit pieces in the sugar-cinnamon mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange pieces in the bottom of the prepared pan. Continue until all biscuits are coated and placed in the pan. If using walnuts and raisins, arrange in and among the biscuit pieces as you go along.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt margarine with the brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Boil for 1 minute. Pour over the biscuits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Let bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a plate. Do not cut! The bread just pulls apart.
